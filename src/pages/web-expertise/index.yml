title: Web Expertise
description: "Iâ€™m an interface designer and frontend developer in love with the web, technologies, making music, taking photos, and riding fixed-gear bicycles.\nI started in 2013 by developing my blog, and since then, I've created a lot of stuff, including personal web pages, useful instruments and tools, plugins for Figma and Sketch, blogs, 3D widgets for visualizing data, and design systems. I used a variety of JavaScript frameworks and libraries (React, Vue, Node.js, etc.). I went through the entire process of developing the idea, from designing to deploying and supporting Linux servers."
